COURSE PROJECT
Phase 2.1: Parser for Lexp

"""
"""

COMMAND TO EXECUTE

unix> python3 scanner.py <input_file> <output_file>

THIS IS THE COMMAND I USED IN ALL MY TESTING. DO NOT USE 
py scanner.py OR python scanner.py

Both files should be in .txt format. The output file should preferably be
an empty file, as the program will erase and overwrite any previously-existing
contents.
The console output will look slightly different than the output in the output
file. This is intentional.
Files included are: README (duh), scanner.py, input, and
output. Test input file is included for convenience, but feel free to use any other
files.

Compiler used is default PyCharm Community Edition

"""
Unfortunately, despite the generous amount of time we had to work
on this project, I ended up running out of time. Running the program
will not yield an Abstract Syntax Tree. I felt as if I were very close,
but again time got the better of me.

During grading, Please refer to the classes PTNode, PTInteriorNode, and
PTLeafNode for code discussed in Module 10 - slides-parser.pdf,
Recursive-descent parsing. Again, I feel as if I was extremely close and
look forward to the possibility of making up for lost ground in Midterm1
and phase 2.2 of the project.
