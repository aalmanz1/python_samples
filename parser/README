COMMAND TO EXECUTE

unix> python3 scanner.py <input_file> <output_file>

THIS IS THE COMMAND I USED IN ALL MY TESTING. DO NOT USE 
py scanner.py OR python scanner.py

Both files should be in .txt format. The output file should preferably be
an empty file, as the program will erase and overwrite any previously-existing
contents.
The console output will look slightly different than the output in the output
file. This is intentional.
Files included are: README (duh), scanner.py, input, and
output. Test input file is included for convenience, but feel free to use any other
files.

Compiler used is default PyCharm Community Edition
